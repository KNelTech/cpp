So to declare an integer variable called score,
we need to write:

int score;

The int is the type of the variable.
The score is the name of the variable.
The ; is how we end a statement.

In C++, variable names consist only of upper/lower case letters,
digits, and/or underscores.
Note: C++ is known as a strongly typed language.
If you try to give an integer value a decimal number,
you are going to get unexpected results, warnings, or errors.
